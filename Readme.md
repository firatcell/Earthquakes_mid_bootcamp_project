# Earthquakes

The aim of this project is to explore and analyze data related to earthquakes given the time frame from 1901 to 2024, including their magnitudes, destructiveness, reported deaths, geographical distribution, likelihood of occurrence, and trends over time. This is achieved using Python and EDA techniques to conduct the analysis and draw insights from the data.

## Questions
#Visualize the geographical distribution of earthquakes
#What is the distribution of Earthquakes?
What earthquake had the highest magnitude?
Whats the total amount of reported deaths?
What earthquake had the highest deaths?
How likely for an earthquake in a region according to data timeframe?
What is the average earthquake magnitude by country?
What is the trend of Earthquakes over time in the country of choice?
What is the trend of Earthquakes over time?
What is the relationship between magnitude and depth?
What is the relationship between magnitude and Total Damage ($Mil)?
At what time during the 24 hour cycle was the most deaths?

What makes an Earthquake destructive?

## Findings

Positive Skew of earthquake distirbution.

The earthquake with the highest magnitude was:
Location Name: CHILE:  PUERTO MONTT, VALDIVIA
Magnitude: 9.5
Date and time: 1960-05-22 19:11:17
Deaths: 2000

The earthquake with the highest deaths was:
Location Name: HAITI:  PORT-AU-PRINCE
Deaths: 316000
Date and time: 2010-01-12 21:53:10
Magnitude: 7.0

The country with the most earthquakes 'China' makes up of about 10% of all Earthquakes.
China has had a positive increase in the average of magnitude of eearthquakes over the time frame of the data.

The trend of magnitude overtime for all earthquakes in data set is also a positive increase of magnitude.
The trend of Magnitude to Focal Depth is a weak positive trend, pointing at a posible non-linear relationship.

The trend for magnitude and Total Damage ($Mil) shows no correlation therefore pointing at a non-linear relationship.

There are 3 time slots with the most deaths, from lowest to highest: 2-4am, 5-7 am and 18-20pm.
