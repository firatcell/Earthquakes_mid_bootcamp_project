# Earthquakes

The aim of this project is to explore and analyze data related to earthquakes given the time frame from 1901 to 2024, including their magnitudes, destructiveness, reported deaths, geographical distribution, likelihood of occurrence, and trends over time. This is achieved using Python and EDA techniques to conduct the analysis and draw insights from the data.<br>

## Objectives
Basic findings<br>
-Earthquake with the highest magnitude?<br>
-Earthquakes with the highest number of deaths<br>
-Total number of reported deaths<br>
-Country with the most Earthquakes?<br>

Distribution of Earthquakes<br>

Visualize the geographical distribution of earthquakes<br>

The affect of Natural disasters on earthquakes<br>

Relationship between Deaths and Damage ($Mil)<br>

Relationship between Magnitude by Damage and Deaths.<br>

Relationship between Intensity by Damage and Deaths.<br>

Relationship between Magnitude and Intensity<br>

Deaths by Time of Day<br>

Other possible factors effecting destructiveness can explore.<br>

Conclusion<br>



What makes an Earthquake destructive?<br>

## Findings

Positive Skew of earthquake distirbution.<br>

The earthquake with the highest magnitude was:
Location Name: CHILE:  PUERTO MONTT, VALDIVIA
Magnitude: 9.5
Date and time: 1960-05-22 19:11:17
Deaths: 2000<br>

The earthquake with the highest deaths was:
Location Name: HAITI:  PORT-AU-PRINCE
Deaths: 316000
Date and time: 2010-01-12 21:53:10
Magnitude: 7.0<br>

The country with the most earthquakes 'China' makes up of about 10% of all Earthquakes.
China has had a positive increase in the average of magnitude of eearthquakes over the time frame of the data.<br>

Positive but Weak correlation of Magnitude by Damage and Deaths.
Positive but slightly stronger than Magnitude, is Intensity by Damage and Deaths.
Time of day -at certain times of day people are more likely to die.
Almost Weak and No correlation between Magnitude and Intensity.
Volcanoes and Tsunamis and Time of day increases death rates and damage.

There are other factors affecting the destructiveness of earthquakes and therefore a non-linear relationship.
